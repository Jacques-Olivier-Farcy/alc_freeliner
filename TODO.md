#### Ideas ####
  * cursor style and size, in different situations a different cursor could be used.
  * strokeWeight offset
  * trigger + segment selector.... (???)
  * rotate acording to clockwise? first segment pA.y>pB.y
  * template linking, link A->B, tweak and trigger affects both, Dont change the values that differ?
  * bumper system
  * Geometry hot swap, reload geometery according to xml file, but not resetting the templates.
  * Per distance repetition?

### VJ specific ###
  * Mirroring render mode? makes a mirrored segmentGroup copy? or a mirrored accessor?
  * Moving geometry...

### FreeLEDing ###
